## Introduction

This website was designed for AK FITNESS, a local fitness company based in south Wales. The focus of the site is to create an online presence for the company, allowing existing and new clientele to gather relevant information regarding the company and the services they offer.

AK FITNESS is a small fitness company with a core focus on fitness in the community, encouraging physical and mental well-being. They have operated for several years and have expanded the area in which classes and services are delivered, whilst continuing to develop the range of services they provide. The purpose of the site was to allow potential and existing clientele to identify locations where services are delivered, the type of services offered, and provide a method of opening direct communication with the company for enquiries.

As the first of four Milestone Projects that must be completed in order to complete the Diploma in Web Application Development, the main requirements were to ensure that the website developed incorporated **HTML5** and **CSS3** to create a responsive and static website across a minimum of three pages.
